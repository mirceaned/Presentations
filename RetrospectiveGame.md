Whodunit is a funny guessing mystery game.
Have something to write with and on so that your teammates can write something exciting they have done that no one knows about (2 cards per person, 5 minutes). For example: I've lived in another country for x years, I won a drink a gallon of milk contest, I've climbed Mount Everest, or I know how to fly a plane.
 
After everyone has written something collect the papers shuffle them and then hand them out. Each person will get a paper, after the papers are distributed they will take turns reading theirs and everyone will guess whodunit.  Moderator will keep the score on the whiteboard. At the end each team member reveals which one is theirs.
