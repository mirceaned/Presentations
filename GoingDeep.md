# Going Deep


## Deep work?
The kind of work requiring concentration. It pushes the subject to the full extent of mental capacities or skills.

This kind of work is done in a state of "flow":
- time flies
- reduced perception of outside reality, hunger, thirst
- feels great, not like a burden
- it takes many minutes to get into it, it takes just a second to go out.

Deep work is usually what we think about when we see a person performing a craft - wood work, playing an instrument, practicing martial arts.


## Deep vs Shallow
By contrast, shallow work is easier, more logistical in nature, it can be done in a state of distraction.
E.g.: answering emails, status report.
- can be addictive
- it creates the illusion of value
- it gives the illusion of visibility
- if done for a long enough time, it can damage your ability to do any focused work whatsoever
Simple way to determine if work is shallow or deep - how many months will it take to train a smart fresh graduate to do the same kind of job?


## Opportunity for knowledge workers
Internet economy cuts both ways: on one hand the rockstars are in high demand, they can easily sell their services to a global audience. On the other hand, average workers that can perform only shallow work are in trouble, because it's easy for employers to leverage a global pool of resources for this kind of work.
1. The ability to peform deep work is an incresingly rare skill.
2. At the same time, demand for deep work increases, as the problems get more complicated.
From these combination, we can hypothesize that whoever takes action and improves their concetration skills will thrive in this economy - ability to understand complicated stuff and to produce at an elite level.


## Is this for everyone?
Probably not, consider a CEO that needs to take decisions quickly based on intuition/experience.
It's not realistic to ask such a person to work for 4 hours on the same problem, it's probably better to have someone else doing the analysis and presenting the results.


## Challenges
Why isn't this the default mode of work?
- Multitasking: switch to something more "exciting", e.g. let's see what this email is about
- Interruptions: chat, questions, phone call, notifications
- Boredom: check emails, news, web browsing (clickbait), social media


## Suggestions
Hypothesis - concentration can be trained, just like a muscle.

At the office
- discuss with your manager how much time should be allocated to shallow work
- find a quiet place for doing deep work (e.g. conf room/library), avoid desk in high traffic areas
- develop a ritual when working: get everything you need such as water, snacks
- deep work and collaboration - hub and spoke offices
- unnecessary meetings

Network tools, email, phone
- consider the benefits of social media vs the downsides, control usage
- if feasible, only check emails at regular intervals
- unsusbcribe/mark as spam any emails/SMS you are not interested in to reduce the clutter
- disable alerts such as new email, push notifications
- blacklist websites

Workflow
- avoid temptation to answer immediately to non urgent emails
- allocate long blocks of time for work on the same task instead of frequent task switching
- consider keeping a list of tasks for periods of waiting for lengthy tasks: build, deploy
- 8 hour burn for sustainable pace

It's not realistic for most knowledge workers to unplug totally from any source of interruption, but much can be done to control it better.
